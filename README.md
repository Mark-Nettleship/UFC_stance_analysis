How stance affects win % in UFC fights 

As a fan of MMA and a martial arts hobbyist, I was interested to see whether a fighter's choice of stance would have a significant impact on the percentage of fights that they won.

Findings:

1. Fighters using a "Switch" stance have a higher average win percentage than fighters using either "orthodox" or "southpaw" stances.
2. There is a statistically significant difference between the win percentage for fighters using a "Switch" stance, and fighters using an "Orthodox" stance.
3. There is a statistically significant difference between the win percentage for fighters using a "Switch" stance, and fighters using a "Southpaw" stance.
4. There is not a statistically significant difference between the win percentage for fighters using a "Orthodox" stance, and fighters using a "Southpaw" stance.
   
Conclusion:

Fighters who can switch stances are likely to win a higher percentage of their fights than fighters who remain in either orthodox or southpaw stances.
